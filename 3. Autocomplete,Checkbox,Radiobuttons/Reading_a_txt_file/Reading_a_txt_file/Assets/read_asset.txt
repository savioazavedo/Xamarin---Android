Assets provide a way to include arbitrary files like text, xml, 
fonts, music, and video in your application. If you try to inclu

If you want to access data untouched, Assets are one way to do i

Next you have to tell Visual Studio that this is an asset file.
 Bring up the properties window for the file and set the BuildA
ction to AndroidAsset:
