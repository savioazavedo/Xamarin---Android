1, Abba Father ,"  Abba father let me be
   Yours and Yours alone
  May my will forever be
   Yours and Yours alone
Never let my heart grow cold
      Never let me go"
2, Above all ," Above all powers,
   above all kings
  Above all nature
and all created things
 
  Above all wisdom
and all the ways of man
    You were here
before the world began
 
  Above all kingdoms,
    above all thrones
   Above all wonders
the world has ever known
 
    Above all wealth
and treasures of the earth
   There's no way to
measure what your worth
 
    Crucified,
Laid behind a stone
 You lived to die,
rejected and alone
 
     Like a rose,
trampled on the ground
   You took the fall
  and thought of me,
      Above all"
3, Adonai ,"One single drop of rain
   Your salty tear
 became blue ocean
One tiny grain of sand
turning in your hand

    A world in motion
  You're out beyond the
  furthest morning star
Close enough to hold me in
        Your arms
 
             Adonai
  I lift up my heart and I cry
            My Adonai
You are maker of each moment
Father of my hope and freedom
         Oh, my Adonai
 One timid faithful knock
    Resounds upon the
       rock of ages
One trembling heart and soul
Becomes a servant bold and
       courageous
 
 You call across the
mountains and the seas
 I answer from the
 deepest part of me
 
  From age to age
you reign in majesty
 And today you're
making miracles in me"
4, Alabare ," 
  Alabare, alabare,
alabare a mi Senor [2]
 
John saw the number,
of all those redeemed,
 And all were singing
 praises to the Lord
 
Thousands were praying
ten thousands rejoicing
 And all were singing
  praises to the Lord"
5, Alive forever more  ," 
      There's no God
  as great as you, O Lord

  There's no God who
does the mighty wonders
     That the Lord
  our God has done!
       (repeat)
 
  Not with an army,
nor with their weapons,
      But by the
  Holy Spirit's Power
       (repeat)
 
  And even mountains
   shall be moved [3]
By the Holy Spirit's power
 
     And even India
    shall be saved [3]
By the Holy Spirit's power

Alive for ever more

My Jesus is alive
  forever more
Sing Hallelujah (2)
My Jesus is alive

11, Amazing Grace ," 
      Amazing Grace!
  How sweet the sound
That saved a wretch like me
      I once was lost,
    but now am found
 Was blind, but now I see.
 
'Twas Grace that taught my
      heart to fear,
And Grace my fears relieved.
  How precious did that
       Grace appear
 The hour I first believed.
 
Through many dangers, toils,
         and snares
    I have already come.
 'Tis Grace hath brought me
        safe thus far
And Grace will lead me home.
 
  The Lord has promised
      good to me.
His Word my hope secures.
    He will my shield
     and portion be
 As long as life endures.
 "
12, Ancient Of Days ," When we've been there
    ten thousand years
 Bright shining as the sun,
 We've no less days to sing
       God's praise
Than when we'd first begun.
 
    Blessing and honor,
      glory and power
 Be unto the Ancient of Days
    From every nation,
       all of creation
Bow before the Ancient of Days
 
   Every tongue in
  Heaven and Earth
Shall declare your glory
   Every knee shall
 bow at your throne
      And worship
 
You will be exalted, Oh God
    And your kingdom
    shall not pass away
    Oh Ancient of Days
 
  Your kingdom shall reign
      over all the Earth
Sing unto the Ancient of Days
  For none can compare to
   your matchless worth
Sing unto the Ancient of Days
 
For You are good, Your love
     endures forever
 And we rejoice in Your
      unfailing love.
 
Consume our praise with fire
    down from heaven
And fill us with Your power
        from above
